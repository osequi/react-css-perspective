When move on the Z axis, perspective has influence on the object.

In fact it makes the movement. Without perspective there is no Z
movement.

Without perspective we can't sense the Z axis.

When the perspective value is small (40px) we are very close to the object and the movement seems very intensive, with high amplitude.

When the perspective is large (2400px) we are very far from the object and the movement is almost invisible.

When the perspective value is close to the object container size (200x200px) the movement is normal.

When move on the X, Y axis perspective has no influence, obviously.
